This data model design includes three main entities: User, Account, and Transaction. The User entity represents individual users of the banking application. The Account entity represents bank accounts associated with a user, and the Transaction entity stores transaction details for each account.

The relationships between these entities are as follows:

- A User can have multiple Accounts (One-to-Many relationship between User and Account)
- An Account can have multiple Transactions (One-to-Many relationship between Account and Transaction)

Remember to consider your application's specific requirements and constraints when designing your data model. This example is a basic starting point, and you may need to add or modify fields, entities, or relationships to fit your needs. Additionally, consider implementing appropriate indexing and constraints (e.g., UNIQUE, NOT NULL) to optimize performance and maintain data integrity.
