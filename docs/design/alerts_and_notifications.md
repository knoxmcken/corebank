Design: Alets and Notifications

1. Notification Types:
    - Define various notification types, such as low balance alerts, deposits, withdrawals, suspicious transactions, and other relevant account activity.

2. User Notification Preferences:
    - Allow users to customize their notification preferences, such as which types of alerts they want to receive and their preferred notification channels (e.g., email, SMS, in-app notifications).

3. Notification Triggers:
    - Implement logic within the application to trigger notifications based on user activity or system events, such as changes in account balance, new transactions, or potential fraud detection.

4. Notification Delivery System:
    - Create a centralized notification delivery system to handle the sending of notifications through various channels (e.g., email, SMS, in-app notifications).
    - Integrate with third-party services, if necessary, to send notifications via specific channels, such as an email service provider for email notifications or an SMS gateway for text messages.

5. Notification Templates:
    - Design templates for each notification type, ensuring they are clear, concise, and contain relevant information for the user.
    - Ensure templates are adaptable for different notification channels, such as plain text for SMS and rich HTML for emails.

6. Notification History:
    - Maintain a log of sent notifications in the database, including information such as notification type, user ID, delivery channel, and timestamp.
    - Provide users with access to their notification history, allowing them to view past notifications within the application.

7. In-App Notifications (Optional):
    - Implement a real-time in-app notification system to display alerts and messages to users while they are using the application.
    - Integrate with technologies such as WebSockets or push notifications for efficient real-time communication.
