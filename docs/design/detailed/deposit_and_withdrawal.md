# Detailed Design: Deposit and Withdrawal

A detailed design for the Deposit and Withdrawal feature would include the following components:


1. Database Schema:
    - Design a database schema that includes tables for accounts, transactions, and users.
    - The accounts table should store account-related information, such as account number, user ID, and balance.
    - The transactions table should store transaction-related information, such as transaction ID, account number, transaction type (deposit or withdrawal), amount, date and time, and an optional description or reference.
    - Ensure proper indexing and relationships are set between tables for optimal performance and data integrity.

2. API Endpoints:
    - Design RESTful API endpoints for deposit and withdrawal operations. These endpoints should accept the required parameters (e.g., account number, amount, description) and return appropriate responses (e.g., success, failure, error messages).
        - POST /api/accounts/{accountNumber}/deposit
        - POST /api/accounts/{accountNumber}/withdraw
    - Implement server-side input validation, error handling, and appropriate response codes for each endpoint.

3. Deposit and Withdrawal Services:
    - Implement server-side services that handle deposit and withdrawal operations. These services should perform the following tasks:
        - Validate the input data, including checking for valid amounts, limits, and account balances.
        - Update the account balance in the accounts table.
        - Create a new transaction record in the transactions table.
    - Use appropriate transaction control mechanisms (e.g., locking, isolation levels) to ensure data consistency and prevent race conditions.

4. User Interface Components:
    - Design and implement user interface components (e.g., using a frontend framework like React, Angular, or Vue.js) for deposit and withdrawal forms.
    - Implement client-side input validation, error handling, and appropriate user feedback.
    - Use AJAX or a similar mechanism to communicate with the API endpoints, sending requests and handling responses without requiring a full page reload.

5. Transaction History Component:
    - Design and implement a user interface component for displaying the user's transaction history.
    - Retrieve the transaction data from the server (e.g., through a RESTful API endpoint like GET /api/accounts/{accountNumber}/transactions) and display it in a paginated, filterable, and sortable table or list view.
    - Optionally, provide functionality for users to download their transaction history in a common format, such as CSV or PDF.

6. Security and Error Handling:
    - Ensure that all user inputs are properly sanitized and validated, both on the client-side and server-side, to prevent security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting.
    - Implement appropriate error handling mechanisms, including client-side input validation, server-side validation, and displaying user-friendly error messages when necessary.
    - Ensure that all API endpoints and services are protected by authentication and authorization mechanisms, preventing unauthorized access.

This detailed design can serve as a blueprint for implementing the Deposit and Withdrawal feature. It can be further expanded upon based on the chosen technology stack, additional requirements, or integration with other features and third-party services.
