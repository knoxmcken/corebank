## Detailed Design: Bill Payment

1. User Interface:

1.1 Biller Management:
    - Create a "Manage Billers" page where users can add, edit, and delete billers.
    - Design an "Add Biller" form that captures biller information, such as:
        * Biller name
        * Biller category (e.g., utilities, credit cards, loans)
        * Account number
        * Billing company name
        * Billing company contact information (e.g., phone, email, website)
    - Display a list of saved billers, allowing users to edit or delete individual billers.

1.2 Bill Payment:
    - Design a "Pay Bill" form that includes:
        * A dropdown list to select a saved biller or an option to enter a new biller's information
        * Input fields for payment amount and payment date (optional)
        * A dropdown list to select the user's funding account
        * A "Submit" button to initiate the payment process
    - Display a confirmation modal with the payment details, prompting the user to confirm or cancel the transaction.

1.3 Payment History:
    - Create a "Payment History" page that displays a table with columns for:
        * Biller name
        * Payment date
        * Payment amount
        * Funding account
    - Implement filtering and sorting options for the payment history table.

2. Data Models:

2.1 Biller:
    - UserID: Foreign key referencing the User model
    - BillerName: String
    - Category: String (e.g., utilities, credit cards, loans)
    - AccountNumber: String
    - CompanyName: String
    - CompanyContactInfo: JSON or related data type to store contact information

2.2 BillPayment:
    - UserID: Foreign key referencing the User model
    - BillerID: Foreign key referencing the Biller model
    - PaymentDate: Date
    - PaymentAmount: Decimal
    - FundingAccountID: Foreign key referencing the Account model

3. Backend Processes:

3.1 Biller Management:
    - Implement API endpoints for adding, updating, and deleting billers, associated with the logged-in user.
    - Validate input data to ensure proper formatting and prevent duplicates.

3.2 Bill Payment Process:
    - Implement an API endpoint for processing bill payments that:
        * Validates the input data (e.g., sufficient account balance, valid payment amount)
        * Deducts the payment amount from the user's selected account
        * Creates a BillPayment record with the transaction details
        * Updates the user's account balance and transaction history
    - If applicable, integrate with the billing company's API or other communication methods to transmit payment information securely.

3.3 Payment History:
    - Implement an API endpoint that retrieves the user's bill payment history, including filtering and sorting options.

4. Notifications and Alerts (Optional):

4.1 Email or SMS Notifications:
    - Integrate with an email or SMS service to send notifications to users confirming successful bill payments or payment reminders.

4.2 In-app Notifications:
    - Implement a notification system within the application to display payment confirmations or payment reminders.
