2. Account Details Component:
    2.1 Retrieve account details from the database using a secure API call, ensuring that only authorized users can access the data.
    2.2 Display the account details in a visually appealing format, using appropriate typography, colors, and layout.
    2.3 Add tooltips or help icons to provide context or explanations for specific terms or elements within the account details.

3. Personal Information Component:
    3.1 Retrieve the user's personal information from the database using a secure API call, ensuring that only authorized users can access the data.
    3.2 Display the personal information in a structured and organized format, using tables or cards for layout.
    3.3 Implement an "Edit" button or similar mechanism to trigger the update process for personal information.

4. Update Personal Information Component:

    4.2 Implement client-side validation for the input fields, such as proper email format, phone number format, and address format, using JavaScript or a validation library.
    4.3 Upon form submission, send a secure API call to update the user's record in the database with the new information.
    4.4 Display a confirmation message to the user upon successful update and refresh the personal information component with the updated data.

5. Transaction History Component:
    5.1 Retrieve the user's transaction history from the database using a secure API call, ensuring that only authorized users can access the data.

    5.3 Provide date range filters, transaction type filters, and a search functionality to allow users to narrow down the transaction history to their desired criteria.
    5.4 Implement pagination for large transaction histories to improve performance and user experience.
    5.5 Add an export feature that allows users to download their transaction history in a standard format, such as CSV or PDF.

6. Error Handling and User Feedback:
    6.1 Implement error handling for API calls and display appropriate error messages to users when an issue occurs.
    6.2 Provide visual feedback, such as loading spinners or progress bars, to indicate ongoing processes, like data retrieval or form submission.
