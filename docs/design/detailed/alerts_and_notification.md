# Detailed Design: Alerts and Notification

This detailed design provides a more in-depth view of the components and processes involved in implementing the Alerts and Notifications feature. The specific implementation details may vary depending on your chosen technology stack and third-party services.

1. Database structure:
   - Create tables in the database to store user notification preferences, notification templates, and notification history.
   - The user notification preferences table should store user ID, notification type, and preferred channels (email, SMS, in-app).
   - The notification templates table should store the notification type, subject, and body for each channel (email, SMS, in-app).
   - The notification history table should store user ID, notification type, channel, status (sent, failed), and timestamp.

2. Notification preferences management:
   - Implement a user interface for users to manage their notification preferences, allowing them to enable/disable specific notification types and choose preferred channels.
   - Store the user's preferences in the user notification preferences table in the database.

3. Notification triggers and event listeners:
   - Identify areas in the application where notifications should be triggered, such as after a transaction, balance change, or potential fraud detection.
   - Implement event listeners or hooks to monitor these events and trigger the notification delivery system accordingly.

4. Notification delivery system:
   - Create a notification delivery service that handles the generation and sending of notifications based on user preferences and templates.
      - Retrieve the user's notification preferences from the database.
      - Retrieve the appropriate notification template based on the event and user's preferred channel.
      - Replace placeholders in the template with relevant event data.
      - Send the notification using the appropriate channel.
         - For email, use an email service provider API, such as SendGrid or Mailgun.
         - For SMS, use an SMS gateway API, such as Twilio or Plivo.
         - For in-app notifications, use a real-time communication service like WebSockets, Firebase Cloud Messaging, or Apple Push Notification Service.
      - Store the notification details in the notification history table, including status (sent or failed) and timestamp.

5. Notification history management:
   - Implement a user interface for users to view their notification history, displaying information such as the notification type, channel, status, and timestamp.
   - Retrieve the notification history from the database based on the user ID.

6. Error handling and retries:
   - Implement error handling in the notification delivery system to gracefully handle failures, such as API timeouts or rate limiting.
   - Optionally, implement a retry mechanism to attempt sending failed notifications again after a specified interval.
