Here's a detailed design for the "Authentication and Authorization" feature, broken down into components and steps:

1. User Registration:

1.1. User Interface:
    - Design a registration form with fields for the user's username, email address, and password.
    - Include a password confirmation field to ensure the user enters their password correctly.
    - Optionally, add a captcha or other anti-bot measures to prevent automated registration attempts.

1.2. Input Validation:
    - Ensure the provided username and email address are unique.
    - Validate the email address format.
    - Enforce password strength requirements (e.g., minimum length, uppercase and lowercase characters, numbers, and special characters).
    - Ensure the password and password confirmation fields match.

1.3. Password Hashing:
    - Use a secure hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt) to hash the user's password.
    - Generate a unique salt for each user and combine it with the password before hashing.
    - Store the hashed password and salt in the user's record in the database.

1.4. Account Creation:
    - Store the user's information, including username, email address, and hashed password, in the database.
    - Assign a unique user ID to each user for future reference.

2. User Login:

2.1. User Interface:
    - Design a login form with fields for the user's username (or email address) and password.
    - Optionally, include a "Remember me" checkbox to enable long-lived sessions.

2.2. Authentication Process:
    - Retrieve the user's record from the database using the provided username or email.
    - If a matching record is found, hash the provided password with the stored salt and compare it to the stored hashed password.
    - If the hashed passwords match, grant the user access and create a secure session (e.g., using encrypted cookies or a secure session management system).

2.3. Multi-Factor Authentication (Optional):
    - If multi-factor authentication is enabled, generate a one-time code and send it to the user's registered email address or phone number.
    - Prompt the user to enter the received one-time code.
    - If the entered code matches the sent code, grant access and create a session.

3. Password Recovery:

3.1. User Interface:
    - Design a password recovery form that captures the user's email address.
    - Optionally, add a captcha or other anti-bot measures to prevent automated password reset attempts.

3.2. Password Reset Token:
    - Generate a unique, time-limited token and store it in the database with an association to the user's account.
    - Send an email to the user's registered email address containing a password reset link with the unique token.

3.3. Password Reset Process:
    - When the user clicks the password reset link, verify the token's validity by checking the database.
    - If the token is valid, display a form for the user to enter a new password and password confirmation.
    - Validate the new password according to the same strength requirements used during registration.
    - If the new password and confirmation match, hash the new password with a new salt, update the user's record in the database, and invalidate the token.

4. Session Management and Security:

4.1. Secure Sessions:
    - Use secure session management mechanisms to store user session information, such as encrypted cookies or server-side session storage.
    - Implement session expiration to automatically log out inactive users.

4.2. Access Control:
    - Ensure that only authenticated users can access protected resources within the application.
    - Implement role-based access control if needed to restrict access to certain features or functionalities based on user roles.

This detailed design can be adapted according to the chosen technology and libraries. 


Additional Considerations:


5. Middleware and Libraries:

5.1. Authentication Middleware:
    - Utilize authentication middleware to verify user authentication status and enforce access control for protected resources within the application.
    - Depending on your technology stack, you may use libraries like Passport.js for Node.js, Devise for Ruby on Rails, or Django's built-in authentication system for Python.

5.2. Password Hashing Libraries:
    - Use a well-established library for hashing and salting passwords, such as bcrypt for Node.js, Bcrypt for Ruby, or Django's built-in password hashing utilities for Python.

5.3. Multi-Factor Authentication Libraries:
    - Implement multi-factor authentication using libraries or services, such as Google Authenticator, Authy, or Twilio Verify.

6. Logging and Auditing:

6.1. Logging:
    - Log authentication-related events, such as login attempts, password changes, and password reset requests, to monitor user activity and detect potential security issues.
    - Ensure that sensitive information, such as passwords or tokens, is not logged in plaintext.

6.2. Auditing:
    - Periodically review authentication logs to identify unusual activity or potential security threats.
    - Implement automated auditing tools to detect and alert administrators of suspicious activity or repeated failed login attempts.
