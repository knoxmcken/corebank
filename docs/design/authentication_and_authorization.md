# Design: Authentication and Authorization

1. User Registration:
    - Create a registration form that captures the user's username, email address, and password.
    - Validate the input data to ensure it meets the application's requirements, such as password strength, unique email address, and unique username.
    - Hash and salt the user's password using a secure hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt) before storing it in the database.
    - Store the user's information in the database, including the hashed password.

2. User Login:
    - Create a login form that captures the user's username (or email address) and password.
    - Retrieve the user's record from the database using the provided username or email.
    - Hash the provided password with the stored salt and compare it to the stored hashed password.
    - If the hashed passwords match, grant the user access and create a session. Store the session information securely (e.g., using encrypted cookies or a secure session management system).
    - Optionally, implement multi-factor authentication by sending a one-time code to the user's registered email address or phone number. The user must enter this code to complete the login process.

3. Password Recovery:
    - Create a password recovery form that captures the user's email address.
    - Generate a unique, time-limited token and store it in the database with an association to the user's account.
    - Send an email to the user's registered email address containing a password reset link with the unique token.
    - When the user clicks the link, verify the token's validity and prompt the user to enter a new password.
    - Hash and salt the new password, update the user's record in the database, and invalidate the token.

4. Multi-Factor Authentication (Optional):
    - If not already implemented during the login process, add an additional step after successful password authentication.
    - Generate a one-time code and send it to the user's registered email address or phone number.
    - Prompt the user to enter the received one-time code. If it matches the sent code, grant access and create a session.

Comment: This high-level design can be used as a starting point for the implemention of the User Authentication and Authorization feature. Depending on the chosen technology stack, specific libraries or frameworks may be used to streamline the development process and ensure secure implementation.
