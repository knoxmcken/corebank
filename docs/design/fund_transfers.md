# Design: Fund Transfers

1. Transfer Types:
    - One-time transfers: These transfers occur immediately or are scheduled for a specific date in the future.
    - Recurring transfers: These transfers occur on a regular schedule, such as weekly or monthly, and continue until a specified end date or until manually canceled by the user.

2. Transfer Form:
    - Create a transfer form that captures the following information:
        - Sender's account (e.g., checking, savings)
        - Recipient's account (either an account owned by the user or another user's account within the same banking system)
        - Transfer amount
        - Transfer date (if applicable, for one-time future-dated or recurring transfers)
        - Transfer frequency (if applicable, for recurring transfers)
        - End date or number of occurrences (if applicable, for recurring transfers)
    - Validate the input data to ensure it meets the application's requirements, such as sufficient balance in the sender's account, valid recipient account, and valid transfer date.

3. Transfer Execution:
    - For immediate one-time transfers:
        - Verify that the sender's account has sufficient funds to cover the transfer amount.
        - Deduct the transfer amount from the sender's account and credit it to the recipient's account.
        - Record the transaction details in both the sender's and recipient's transaction histories.
    - For future-dated one-time transfers or recurring transfers:
        - Store the transfer details in a scheduled transfers table in the database, including the transfer frequency and end date for recurring transfers.
        - Implement a background job or scheduler to periodically check for pending transfers and execute them when their scheduled date arrives. Ensure that the job follows the same steps as immediate one-time transfers, including verifying account balances, updating account balances, and recording transaction details.

4. Transfer Management:
    - Allow users to view their scheduled and past transfers in a dedicated section of the application.
    - Provide the ability for users to edit or cancel pending future-dated or recurring transfers.
    - Ensure that any changes to the scheduled transfers are validated and updated in the database accordingly.
