# Design: Account Management

1. Account Details:
    - Retrieve the user's account details from the database, including account number, balance, and transaction history.
    - Display the account details to the user in a user-friendly format, with clear labels and a well-organized layout.
    - Consider using charts or graphs to provide visual representation of transaction history and account balance over time.

2. Personal Information:
    - Retrieve the user's personal information from the database, including email address, phone number, and mailing address.
    - Display the personal information to the user in an organized manner, allowing the user to review their current information.
    - Provide an "Edit" button or similar mechanism for the user to update their personal information.

3. Update Personal Information:
    - Create a form that captures the user's updated personal information, pre-populating the fields with their current data.
    - Validate the input data to ensure it meets the application's requirements, such as proper email format, phone number format, and address format.
    - Update the user's record in the database with the new information and provide a confirmation message to the user upon successful update.

4. Transaction History:
    - Retrieve the user's transaction history from the database, including details such as transaction date, amount, description, and transaction type (e.g., deposit, withdrawal, transfer, bill payment).
    - Display the transaction history to the user in a sortable and filterable table or list format, allowing the user to view transactions by date range, type, or other relevant criteria.
    - Provide an option to export the transaction history in a standard format, such as CSV or PDF, for the user's personal record-keeping.
