# Design: Deposit and Withdrawal

1. Deposit:
    1.1 Create a deposit form that captures the amount to be deposited and optionally, a transaction description or reference.
    1.2 Validate the input data to ensure the deposit amount is within the allowed limits and follows the application's rules, such as minimum or maximum deposit amounts.
    1.3 Update the user's account balance by adding the deposit amount.
    1.4 Create a transaction record in the database with details including transaction type (deposit), amount, date and time, and description or reference (if provided).
    1.5 Display a confirmation message to the user and update the account balance displayed in the user interface.

2. Withdrawal:
    2.1 Create a withdrawal form that captures the amount to be withdrawn and optionally, a transaction description or reference.
    2.2 Validate the input data to ensure the withdrawal amount is within the allowed limits, doesn't exceed the user's account balance, and follows the application's rules, such as minimum or maximum withdrawal amounts.
    2.3 Update the user's account balance by subtracting the withdrawal amount.
    2.4 Create a transaction record in the database with details including transaction type (withdrawal), amount, date and time, and description or reference (if provided).
    2.5 Display a confirmation message to the user and update the account balance displayed in the user interface.

3. Transaction History:
    3.1 Create a transaction history page that displays a list of the user's transactions, including deposits, withdrawals, and other transaction types (such as fund transfers or bill payments).
    3.2 Retrieve the user's transaction records from the database and display them in a paginated, filterable, and sortable table or list view.
    3.3 Provide an option for users to download their transaction history in a common format, such as CSV or PDF.
